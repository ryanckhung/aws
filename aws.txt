Open an account:
1. [HOL] Root -> email and credit card
2. [HOL] IAM -> AWS Account -> Account Alias
3. [HOL] IAM -> MFA
4. [HOL] Account -> Billing Dashboard -> Billing Preferences -> Receive Free Tier Usage Alerts
5. [HOL] Cloud Watch -> Alarms -> Billing -> Create Alarm

IAM:
1. User should add into group, then policy apply to the group, 
2. [HOL] Create user -> IAM -> users
3. Role will have polcies (trust policy and permission policy) attached to it and tell which resource have right to assume the role and get the sts token; STS just like a temporary password; STS will auto renew when it's almost expire; 
4. [HOL] Change password policy -> IAM -> Account Settings -> Change Password Policy
5. Identity based policy and resource based policy (Role is some how a resource based policy which attched with trust policy and permission policy)
6. Permission has it's logic sequence. For example, S3 has a reousce policy and Peter has an identity policy. When Peter access S3, it will first check the RESORUCE POLICY, if it's allowed, AWS will check Peter's identity policy. If resource policy rejected Peter, AWS won't check for Peter's identiy policy.
7. [HOL] IAM Policy Simulator: IAM Dashboard -> right hand side (Tools) -> Policy Simulator

EC2:
1. [HOL] Create EC2 -> EC2 Dashboard -> Select Region -> Launch Instance [if it's not working, most likely due to the port not yet open in the security group OR in private subnet] -> Remark: open in browser use http://public-ip
2. User Data: user script (.sh) run at the initializing the instance; 
3. Meta data: Information related to the instance [in any EC2 instance, you can run > curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data]
4. There are 2 ways for an EC2 to access the other services like database/S3; they are the "Access Key" or "Role"; best practice is use role; because access key must be stored in somewhere which is not secure; Access Key can be refer to IAM -> user -> security credentials -> create access key; Role -> IAM -> Roles -> Create Role -> AWS Services -> EC2 -> Select the policies -> after create the role back to the EC2 dashboard -> check the instance -> Actions -> Security -> Modify IAM role
5. [HOL] Monitoring -> EC2 -> EC2 Dashboard -> Select a running EC2 instance -> Scroll down and check "Status Checks" and "Monitoring" [These data are coming from cloud watch, you can goto cloud watch page and check the details; EC2 Monitoring is automatically created as the instance created, it check every 5 minutes and it's free. If you want to monitor more closely, you can goto "Monitoring" -> "Manage detailed monitoring" -> check the "enable", then it will monitor every 1 minutes (need to pay extra fee)] To check the monitoring data in cloud watch -> remember the instance ID or name -> Cloud Watch Dashboard -> Metrics -> All Metrics
6. [HOL] Working with Network Interface -> There are 3 types of network interface -> start a EC2 instance -> EC2 Dashboard -> Network & Security -> Network Interfaces -> Create Network Interface -> Network Interfaces dashboard; check the newly created network interface; Actions; Attach; select the EC2 instance to be attached
7. Private IP always attached to the EC2 (unless you terminate and recreate; stop the EC2 private IP will retain); Public IP will always change after the EC2 is stop (reboot will still keep the public IP); for public IP which fix IP, you need Elastic IP
8. [HOL] Elastic IP -> EC2 dashboard -> Network & Security -> Elastic IPs (need to pay if it's not in use) -> can assign the elastic ip to an instance or a network interface ->
