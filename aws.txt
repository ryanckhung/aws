IAM:
1. User should add into group, then policy apply to the group, 
2. [HOL] Create user -> IAM -> users
3. Role will have polcies (trust policy and permission policy) attached to it and tell which resource have right to assume the role and get the sts token; STS just like a temporary password; STS will auto renew when it's almost expire; 
4. [HOL] Change password policy -> IAM -> Account Settings -> Change Password Policy
5. Identity based policy and resource based policy (Role is some how a resource based policy which attched with trust policy and permission policy)
6. Permission has it's logic sequence. For example, S3 has a reousce policy and Peter has an identity policy. When Peter access S3, it will first check the RESORUCE POLICY, if it's allowed, AWS will check Peter's identity policy. If resource policy rejected Peter, AWS won't check for Peter's identiy policy.

1. [HOL] Create EC2 -> EC2 Dashboard -> Select Region -> Launch Instance [if it's not working, most likely due to the port not yet open in the security group OR in private subnet] -> Remark: open in browser use http://public-ip
2. User Data: user script (.sh) run at the initializing the instance; 
3. Meta data: Information related to the instance [in any EC2 instance, you can run > curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data]

[HOL] Monitoring -> EC2 -> EC2 Dashboard -> Select a running EC2 instance -> Scroll down and check "Status Checks" and "Monitoring" [These data are coming from cloud watch, you can goto cloud watch page and check the details; EC2 Monitoring is automatically created as the instance created, it check every 5 minutes and it's free. If you want to monitor more closely, you can goto "Monitoring" -> "Manage detailed monitoring" -> check the "enable", then it will monitor every 1 minutes (need to pay extra fee)] To check the monitoring data in cloud watch -> remember the instance ID or name -> Cloud Watch Dashboard -> Metrics -> All Metrics
