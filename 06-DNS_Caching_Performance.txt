Route 53 is a DNS server; It can use routing polices to route data; eg, you have one domain name can map to several IPs (or data centre), you can use routing policies to route data to different IPs; Routing Polices: Simple, failover, geolocation, latency, multi value answer (act as a load Balancer), base on weight

Route 53 can also have domain registration, hosted domain, health checks, traffic flow features.

[HOL] Register Domain with Route 53: Route 53 -> Domain Registration -> choose a domain name ->  Fill in contact data and make the payment -> after done goto Host zones to check

Hosted zone = a set of records belonging to a domain; you can create the DNS record like A record (domain name and IP mapping); TTL = 60 means the browser can cache 60 seconds for the DNS results 

Private Hosted Zone -> create a private domain name (anything you want) associate with the VPC; Enable DNS hostnames means enable the DNS resolution; then it route53 will just act as a private DNS to resolve the IP to private domain name internally

Migration to / from route 53 by import and export the record to and from other DNS provider.

[HOL] Using Route 53 Routing Policies: Set EC2 within nginx in different regions ->  Back to Route 53; Hosted zones; select the domain name -> Create Record -> set as A record, IP address, routing policy (select the type like weight, latency, geo, etc.), Done -> use VPN to switch country and try the launched EC2 


CloudFront is a content delivery network; it caches data in different location
CloudFront Origins = where the origin data store, eg S3, EC2, in one physical location
Edge Location are all over the world. The content will cache in the edge location to improve the transmission performance
Users are directed automatically to the nearest edge location; if the content is expired in the edge location, it will pull form the origin again
To create cloudFront Distribution, you need to tell the name like “xxx.abc.com”, and the Origin (like S3 or EC2 instance)
TTL determine the content to store in the cache, when it's expired, it will be deleted
decreasing TTL is best for dynamic content
increasing TTL is better for performance
