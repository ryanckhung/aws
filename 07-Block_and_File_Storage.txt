S3 - Object Based Storage System (Use HTTP protocol to GET/PUT/POST/DELETE)
Hard drive - Block based (OS communicating hard drive at block level; low level way to connect to disk)
Network Attached Storage - File based (eg. NAS shares filesystems over the network; remote computer can mount to the drive and perform RW)

Object Storage (S3), File Storage (Amazon Elastic File System), Block Storage (Amazon Elastic Block Store)

EBS exist in single availability zone (AZ), can't cross AZ
1 EBS can connect to 1 EC2; but 1 EC2 can connect to many EBS
But EBS multi-attach (most of the ESB type doesn't support) does allow you to connect from mulitple Nitro system based EC2 to a single EBS
SSD can be classified as General Purpose SSD and Provisioned IOPS SSD (higher performance)
EBS persist independently of the life of the EC2 instance
EBS don't need to attach to an instance
Root EBS Volumes are deleted on instance termination 
Non root EBS volumes are not deleted on termination
Backup EBS and copy to other AZ's EBS; by using S3, you can also create the data as AMI (image)
EBS snapshots usually stores in S3
Data Life Cycle Management (DLM)- it can create a snapshot and AMIs from EBS volume automatically
EC2 instance store volumes are physically attached to the host; while EBS are connect through the network
