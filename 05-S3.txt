S3 is an object based storage system
S3 bucket is a container for objects; AWS fully managed, fully scalable
you can access the bucket object by URL (https), the URL format maybe
https://<bucket>.s3.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<key>
https://s3.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<bucket>/<key>
<bucket> is bucket name, <aws-region> is the aws region name, <key> is the object name (the value is the content of the file)
Use Restful API to access the S3 bucket
S3 bucket name must be unique gobally
S3 bucket is located in a selected region; that is your data is in a specify region
No Hierarchy for objects within a bucket; you should included a folder like structure in the name (key) of the file; eg animals/dog.txt (animals/dog is the name/key of the file); all the object in S3 are in the same level
Bucket can't inside the other bucket. 
S3 is public facing, you can access it through internet; you can use S3 gateway endpoint in VPC to make a secure connect to S3 (just like intranet)
