S3 is an object based storage system
S3 bucket is a container for objects; AWS fully managed, fully scalable
you can access the bucket object by URL (https), the URL format maybe
https://<bucket>.s3.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<key>
https://s3.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<bucket>/<key>
<bucket> is bucket name, <aws-region> is the aws region name, <key> is the object name (the value is the content of the file)
Use Restful API to access the S3 bucket
S3 bucket name must be unique gobally
S3 bucket is located in a selected region; that is your data is in a specify region
No Hierarchy for objects within a bucket; you should included a folder like structure in the name (key) of the file; eg animals/dog.txt (animals/dog is the name/key of the file); all the object in S3 are in the same level
Bucket can't inside the other bucket. 
S3 is public facing, you can access it through internet; you can use S3 gateway endpoint in VPC to make a secure connect to S3 (just like intranet)

There are many storage class in S3 (standard, intelligent tiering, stardard-IA, One Zone-IA, Glacier, Glacier Deep Archive)
Standard - default
intelligent tiering - move data for you between stroage classes based on access patterns
standard IA - standard infrequently access
One zone ia - infrequently access data but it's only stored in one availability
Glacier - for archiving
Glacier deep archive - for archiving
all with eleven 9 durability - 99.999999999%
Data availability may due to network error but not the harddrive failure 
There are minimum storage during chrage for all storage class except the standard package (it may take 30 days ~ 180 days min. charge depends on differnt classes)
Retrieval fee for cold storage is expensive
S3 Storage class selection is an art between cost, data access frequency
S3 is a region wise service but the actual storage is in a specific region

[HOL] Create Amazon S3 Bucket: S3 Dashboard, create bucket -> give bucket name, select a region (public access is blocked by default, you can add select encryption for data) -> Done
You can back to S3 and upload file to the S3 bucket that you just created; after uploading the file, you can speicfy the property of that file, you can select storage class here (eg. standard, Glacier, etc)
each uploaded file will have it's unique URL
