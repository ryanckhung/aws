S3 - Object Based Storage System (Use HTTP protocol to GET/PUT/POST/DELETE)
Hard drive - Block based (OS communicating hard drive at block level; low level way to connect to disk)
Network Attached Storage - File based (eg. NAS shares filesystems over the network; remote computer can mount to the drive and perform RW)

Object Storage (S3), File Storage (Amazon Elastic File System), Block Storage (Amazon Elastic Block Store)

EBS exist in single availability zone (AZ), can't cross AZ (EC2 in AZ-A can't access EBS in AZ-B)
1 EBS can connect to 1 EC2; but 1 EC2 can connect to many EBS
But EBS multi-attach (most of the ESB type doesn't support) does allow you to connect from mulitple Nitro system based EC2 to a single EBS
SSD can be classified as General Purpose SSD and Provisioned IOPS SSD (higher performance)
EBS persist independently of the life of the EC2 instance
EBS don't need to attach to an instance
Root EBS Volumes are deleted on instance termination (can be edit as "retain after EC2 delete" when create the EC2 instance)
Non root EBS volumes are not deleted on termination
Backup EBS and copy to other AZ's EBS; by using S3, you can also create the data as AMI (image)
EBS snapshots usually stores in S3
Data Life Cycle Management (DLM)- it can create a snapshot and AMIs from EBS volume automatically
EC2 instance store volumes are physically attached to the host; while EBS are connect through the network

Instance store volumes are high performance local disk that physically attached to host computer on which an EC2 runs.
Instance store are ephemeral
When create a EC2 there is a new root device which is EBS by default

EBS volume is network attached drive which results in slow performance but data is persistent meaning even if you reboot the instance data will be there.
Instance store instance store provides temporary block-level storage for your instance. This storage is located on disks that are physically attached to the host computer.

[HOL] Creating and Attaching EBS Volumes: when creating EC2, you can add more new volumes (default will have 1), or create a EBS and attach back the EC2 later -> After created the EC2; goto Elastic Block Store, Volume, Create Volume, Make sure it put it the right AZ, Done -> Back to the Volume page, select the newly created volume and attach it to the EC2 instance

[HOL] Amazon Machine Image (AMI) similar to docker Image but it's for the AWS VM or ESB -> EC2 dashboard, select a created instance, actions, image and templates, create image, give an image name, create the image (by default, when the image is creating, the EC2 will be terminate then generate image then start again) -> Back to EC2 Dashboard, check AMIs, you will see there is an image created; and also check the snapshot, there will be a napshot created -> goto the AMIs, click Launch to create an Instance through AMIs -> OR goto EC2 dashboard, Launch instances, My AMIs, select your AMIs, then create the EC2 as usual (REMARK: AMI image just the image of the running instance, you still need to config the instance type, VPC, subnet, harddisk, security group)

Keeping Virtual Machine and container images up-to-date can be time consuming, resource intensive, and error-prone. Currently, customers either manually update and snapshot VMs or have teams that build automation scripts to maintain images.
Image Builder significantly reduces the effort of keeping images up-to-date and secure by providing a simple graphical interface, built-in automation, and AWS-provided security settings. With Image Builder, there are no manual steps for updating an image nor do you have to build your own automation pipeline.
Image Builder is offered at no cost, other than the cost of the underlying AWS resources used to create, store, and share the images.

EC2 Image Builder is a tool to create, customize, manage and distribute EC2 images.
[HOL] EC2 Image Builder -> EC2 Dashboard, AMIs, EC2 Image Builder -> Create image pipeline -> Before create image pipeline, back to create a IAM Role for EC2 (allow AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore, EC2InstanceProfileForImageBuilder) -> back to EC2 dashboard, AMIs, EC2 image builder, create image pipeline -> enter name, build schdule, create a new recipe (can be AMI image or docker image), select an image (eg. ubuntu, centos), build components (eg. cloudwatch agent) -> Create a new infrastructure configuration, pick the role just created, instance type, VPC, subnet, security group -> Create the pipeline, then Done -> Back to the "EC2 Image Builder" page, and you will see a newly created image pipeline, check it and click actions, Run pipeline (it take a very long time) -> back to the EC2 instance page, you will see a new instance is created

[HOL] Migrate EBS Volume between AZs -> EC2 Dashboard, Volumes, select a volume, click Actions and create snapshot -> snapshot is created and stored in S3 -> in the snapshot page, you can edit the permission
To copy the snapshot to other region: by select the snapshot, select Actions, select copy 
To create a volume with the created snapshot: by select the snapshot, select Actions, create volume

[HOL] Working with EBS Snapshots and DLM (Data Lifecycle Manager), DLM will help to automate the backup of EC2 instance by using snapshot -> EC2 dashboard, Volumes, select one of the created volume, goto Tags tab and add a tag (eg DLM=Weekly) -> Then goto EC2 Dashboard, Lifecycle Manager -> Set Target resource type as Volume, set target resource tags as DLM=Weekly -> set the schedule details as Weekly, set the retaintion (eg. keep the snapshot for 2 weeks) -> Done 

AWS not support RAID, but you can set it in OS level.


Elastic file system - file based storage using NFS protocol (Network file system)
Create VPC, create a file system within the VPC, EC2 connector the EFS by NFS protocol
EFS can connect thousands of instance simultaneously; for linux based system

[HOL] Create EFS Filesystem -> Create a new security group allow inbound with NFS traffic -> goto the EFS dashboard, click create file system, click Customize, give name and select the option base on your need (once the EFS is setted up, the configuration can't be changed) -> associate the newly created security group to the EFS (in network access page) -> EFS creation done -> goto the EFS page and copy the "File system ID" -> goto the ssh of EC2 instance, create a mount directory "sudo mkdir efs", run "sudo yum install -y amazon-efs-utils" (this install the EFC utility), then run "sudo mount -t efs xxxxx-file-sys-id efs/" (mount the efs with the EC2 mount directory)

FSx for Windows: for windows based application
FSx for Lustre: for compute-intensive (use case: machine learning, high performance computing, video processing); works natively with S3 (on the other hand behind luster is S3)

AWS Storage Gateway enables you to connect the on-premises stroage to AWS
AWS Storage Gateway - File Gateway: connect to your storage gateway and mounting the file system using NFS or SMB; file gateway provides a virtual on-premises file server; store and retrive files as objects in S3; just like a mapping between File system to object based storage;
AWS Storage Gateway - Volume Gateway: two type of volume gateway, cached volume mode (cached will store in the on-premise, entire data set store in S3), stored volume mode
ASW Storage Gateway - Tape Gateway

[HOL] AWS Backup: it can back up for volume, database -> AWS Backup dashboard -> Create Backup Plan, start with a template, edit backup rule (like backup frequency) -> Done -> back to the AWS Backup Dashboard, select resource assignments, click assign resources, assign resource by tag or resource id (reousrce can be dynamoDB, EBS, EC2, EFS, FSx, RDS, Storage Gateway)
