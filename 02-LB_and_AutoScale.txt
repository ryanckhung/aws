1. Amazon Web Services defines Elasticity as "The ability to acquire resources as you need them and release resources when you no longer need them."
2. Scaling up = vertical scaling; scaling out = horizontal scaling
3. Auto Scaling includes the concept of Launch Templates and Auto Scaling Group
4. [HOL] Auto Scaling: EC2 Dashboard -> Instances -> Launch Templates -> Launch template is just like telling AWS that you have a EC2 template, which include the image type, machine type, security group, key pair, storage, etc -> back to the EC2 dashboard and select Auto Scaling -> Auto Scaling Groups -> Create Auto Scaling Groups -> Associate the Launch Template just crated with the Auto Scaling Group -> you can select mulitple AZ and subnets for autoscaling -> you can set the desire, min, max number of instances to run -> after the ASG is created, the EC2 instance will automatically created -> Back to the EC2 dashbard, auto scaling and selected the just created Auto Scaling group (ASG), play around and take a look on the monitoring [you shouldn't directly change the setting of EC2 created by ASG; you should goto ASG to update the EC2 instead][delete the ASG will automatically deleted the EC2][you shoun't delete the EC2 which is created by ASG; you should delete the ASG instead]
5. Load Balancing includes the concept of ALB/NLB and Target Group, the Load Balancer will redirect traffic to difference target group
6. [HOL] Create Target Group -> EC2 Dashboard -> Load Balancing -> Target Groups -> You can create a target group protocol for http (ALB) or TCP (NLB)-> You can not include any EC2 instance in this target group and leave it to update later
7. [HOL] Create NLB -> create the Elastic IP for Load Balancer -> create Load Balancer, EC2 Dashboard, Load Balancers, Create Load Balancer -> Forward the listener (eg. TCP @ port 80) to the target groups which created before -> After created the Load Balancer, copy it's endpoint name -> if you following the lab, the target groups should be empty -> back to the ASG and select the created ASG instance, goto load balancing option under the ASG instance, attach the newly created Load Balancer to the ASG instance -> after that the target group will auto include the instance stated in the ASG
