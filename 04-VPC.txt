1. Each VPC will have it's own CIDR block. This CIDR block will use across the AZ and subnets. For example the VPC with CIDR = 10.0.0.0/16.
   Then in Zone A -> public subnet with CIDR = 10.0.0.0/24; private subnet with 10.0.1.0/24
   Then in Zone B -> public subnet with CIDR = 10.0.2.0/24; private subnet with 10.0.3.0/24
   all CIDR must fall within 10.0.0.0/16; in other word the subnet must with the CIDR block which is the subset of the overall CIDR block address
   In AWS, CIDR block must within /16 - /24; once the CIDR is set, you can't change it, therefore need to plan carefully; 
   You can't overlap the CIDR Block between VPCs;
