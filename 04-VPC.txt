1. Each VPC will have it's own CIDR block. This CIDR block will use across the AZ and subnets. For example the VPC with CIDR = 10.0.0.0/16.
   Then in Zone A -> public subnet with CIDR = 10.0.0.0/24; private subnet with 10.0.1.0/24
   Then in Zone B -> public subnet with CIDR = 10.0.2.0/24; private subnet with 10.0.3.0/24
   all CIDR must fall within 10.0.0.0/16; in other word the subnet must with the CIDR block which is the subset of the overall CIDR block address
   In AWS, CIDR block must within /16 - /24; once the CIDR is set, you can't change it, therefore need to plan carefully; 
   You can't overlap the CIDR Block between VPCs;

2. [HOL] VPC Wizard -> VPC Service -> Launch VPC Wizard (create the VPC by Wizard; somehow automated by filling a little bit information)

3. [HOL] Create a Custom VPC with subnets -> [1] VPC -> Create VPC -> CIDR block can set at 10.0.0.0/16 as long as it's not overlap with others -> in the created VPC; select actions; edit DNS hostnames; enable it (this makes the dns hostname for the ec2 instance available) -> [2] create subnets -> VPC dashboard -> subnets -> Create Subnet -> Selecte the newly created VPC, give subnet name, assign AZ, assign CIDR block (up to this moment you just created the subnet; all assume to be private subnet) -> in the subnet list page, check the subnet you want to be in public subnet, click Actions, select Modify auto-assign IP settings, check "enable auto assign public IPv4 address -> [3] create a route table of the private subnet (don't let it to route outside) -> Route tables -> Create Route Table -> assign route table name, associate it with the newly created VPC -> after route table created, select the route table, select subnet associations, click edit subnet associations, select the private subnet which crated in step [2] -> [4] create a internet gateway -> back to VPC dashboard and create a internet gateway -> just give a name, then internet gateway is crated -> after gateway internet gateway is created, select it and click Actions, Attach to VPC -> [5] back to route table and edit the main route table with 0.0.0.0/0 point to the internet gateway -> [6] VPC, private, public subnet, route table and internet gateway are created; a whole basic set up is completed

4 [HOL] continue the above (continue optional setting) -> [7] Create a NAT gateway -> assign a name and MUST put it in the PUBLIC subnet, allocate Elastic IP -> [8] update the route table of the private subnet -> check the private subnet, click the Routes tab, Add Route with 0.0.0.0/0 point to NAT gateway -> [9] Create Security Group -> Assign name, assoicate with the new VPC, set in bound and out bound will all permission (all traffic go in and out) for testing purpose
