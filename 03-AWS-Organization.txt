1. AWS organizations is a service that enables us to create one organization for many AWS accounts.
2. Example: Under the AWS Organization, you have a Management Account, Production Account, Development Account. You can group account into Organization Unit (OU) and the Service Control Polices (SCP) will be attached into the Organization Unit.
3. Create an account here is not assigning using name and password; but creating a role: OrganizationAccountAccessRole (eg. a role is assoicated with the prodution account); then the user in the management account can assume the role
4. [HOL] Create Organization and Account -> [1] AWS Organizations Service -> Create an Organization (after clicking this button, then done; all the things are created automatically) (you can see the management account as root) -> In side the AWS accounts page, click "Add an AWS Account" button to create an aws account -> give the name of the account, link with a new email account (can't be the root account), like with an IAM Role (use default OrganizationAccountAccessRole) -> [2] goto AWS Accounts page, select root, select children, actions, create new organization unit (OU) and give the name (prouction in this example) for this OU -> move the newly created account to OU (production)

Defualt is SCP is assoicate with the default organization unit (root), Under the defualt organization unit (root) there will be the default AWS account (management account); similiary you can create your own SCP assoicate with an OU, under the OU assgin the aws accounts in
