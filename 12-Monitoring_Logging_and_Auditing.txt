CLoudWatch: require install agents on the instances or on-premises servers; for monitoring and logging
CloudTrial: is for auditing; capture information about every API action that takes place in the AWS account;
* Remark: agent is installed in the client, eg. EC2 to send metric to CloudWatch

CloudWatch is a performance monitoring tool; collect performance metrics from AWS and on-premises systems; 
CloudWatch Metrics is a services send time ordered data to CloudWatch; metrics are sent to CloudWatch from other AWS Services; EC2 by default send out the metrics every 5 minutes (free); Unified CloudWatch Agent will give extra information like memory and disk usage;
CloudWatch Alarms can monitor metrics and initiate actions; two type of alarms, Metric alarm (base on single metric), Composite alarm (base on rule expression)
CloudWatch Logs is a centralised collection of system and application logs
CloudWatch Events stream of system events describing change to AWS resource and can trigger actions

[HOL] Create a Custom Metric: (use command line to send a custom metric to CloudWatch from Amazon EC2)
Run an EC2 instance, create a role with permissions to be able to put the metric data to the CloudWatch; 
Create a Role, set use case as EC2, attach policy “cloudWatchAgentServerPolicy, after created the role attach it to the EC2 instance (select the EC2, Actions, Security, Modify IAM Role, select the created role);
Connect the EC2 by SSH then use an API call to trigger the metric
Then back to cloud watch and check the events; Goto CloudWatch Dashboard, click All metrics, check the custom namespace 

[HOL] Create a CloudWatch Alarm: (base on the collected matric to trigger the alarm)
Goto CloudWatch dashboard, click All alarms, Create alarm, select metric, select the metric which generated from the previous lab; drill down and select a particular metric; goto Conditions, set for example Greater than a particular threshold; Next; select EC2 action and select then the state is “in alarm” then “terminate the instance”; (simply speaking the cloud watch will check the metric and see if the condition meet, then take some actions) -> Create the alarm -> Done;
To test it, you can ssh into the EC2 instance and use API to send some value which is over the condition and trigger the event


Amazon CloudWatch Logs gather application and system logs in CloudWatch; 

[HOL] Review CloudWatch Logs: 
Goto CloudWatch Dashboard, under Logs click Log groups (all the logs from different services are put here it’s automatically grouped by the CloudWatch log. Eg. It will group logs from lambda with a particular function), Click into the logs groups, under the log metrics tab you will find the logs stream of a particular log group; Under subscription filters tab, when the information comes in the cloud watch logs will be forwarded to the subscribers like lambda; you can play around it
Back to the CloudWatch Dashboard, under Logs click Log insights, select the log groups, then you can run a query (sql like statement)


The Unified CloudWatch Agent can collect internal system-level metrics from EC2 instances; it also can collect metric from on-premises servers; the unified cloud watch metrics can get more advanced metrics when compare to the default cloudWatch metric (eg. Disk, memory information);

AWS CloudTrial use for capturing information about the API actions generates in the AWS account (eg. Laugh an EC2 instance, create Lambda function or modify resource will trigger the APIs call - no matter if you are using AWS console, CLI, API or SDK) (it is not taking about the API you created by node.js and put it in EC2);
CloudTrial logs API activity for auditing; by default the logs are stored for 90 days 

[HOL] Create a CloudTrial Trial
Goto the AWS CloudTrial Dashboard,  in the left navigation menu click Trials, click Create trials, give a name, Create new S3 bucket (to store the logs) it will automatically give you a S3 bucket name, you can select the Management events, Data events or insight events;  done; play around it


EventBridge used to be known as CloudWatch Events; There are many events sources send the events to the EventBridge; the event bridge base on the rule and determine what to do next

[HOL] Create EventBridge rule for CloudTrial API calls: (API happens and cloud trial record it in S3, then we want to be able to automatically respond to that information and trigger an event) (in this lab, we stop the EC2 instance, an API action is generated, then we run the lambda function, then send information to cloud watch logs)
1. Create a Lambda function, select Use a blueprint, type hello to find the hello world blueprint; [do it later]
