Type of database in AWS:
Database on EC2: running database in EC2, fully managed by user
Amazon RDS: AWS managed relation database
Amazon DynamoDB: AWS managed NoSQL
Amazon RedShift: Data warehouse for large volume of aggregated data
Amazon ElasticCache: Fast temporary storage for small amounts of data
Amazon EMR: Analytics workloads using the Hadoop framework
