Relational Database; Scale Vertically; Amazon RDS, MySQL, IBM DB2, PostgreSQL; talking about column, row, table, schema; use for operation/transaction CRUD operation
Non-Relational Database: Scale Horizontally; DynamoDB, MongoDB, Redis, Neo4j, graph database (store relationships between different people); talking about key value pairs, document; for analytical (like big data)

The data store in analytical database (NonSQL) usually come from the operational databases (SQL); Example, lots of Amazon RDS databases (for operations) copy the data to the centralised data warehouse (eg. Amazon Redshift for data analysis)

Type of database in AWS:
Database on EC2: running database in EC2, fully managed by user
Amazon RDS: AWS managed relation database
Amazon DynamoDB: AWS managed NoSQL
Amazon RedShift: Data warehouse for large volume of aggregated data
Amazon ElasticCache: Fast temporary storage for small amounts of data
Amazon EMR: Analytics workloads using the Hadoop framework

Amazon Relational Database Service (it run on EC2 but fully managed by AWS):  
You can run Amazon Aurora, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL (other than these, you need to run on EC2 by yourself)
It can scale up vertically by upgrade the hardware like CPU, memory
RDS can have disaster recovery and scaling out (horizontally) features:
Disaster Recovery: have 1 RDS Master for read and write in AZ-A, have other RDS Standby in AZ-B, master will sync to standby instance (db should set in different availability zone)
Scaling Out: 1 RDS Master and RDS Read Replica; read replicas use asynchronous replication; RDS read replica is used for scaling read (only for queries);
RDS can be encrypted and take snapshots
RDS can configure with a backup window (backup start time and duration) the backup will become the snapshot; the snapshot can be restored back; in single AZ zone, the DB will be suspension for a while for backup (in multi AZ, no suspension will happen)


[HOL] Create Amazon RDS Database: Amazon RDS, Create database -> standard create, choose engine options (eg. MySQL, MaraDB), edit name of DB, give username and password, edit DB instance (hardware), edit storage, storage autoscaling, you can edit VPC, subnet, Enable automated backups, backup retention period, monitoring, maintenance (auto upgrade for minor version) (free tire will have fewer options)
After the DB is created, select the DB and click Connectivity and Security, find the endpoint which is used to connect to the database
Since the AWS managed RDS also implemented in EC2, therefore an inbound security rule on port 3306 must be enabled
If automatic backup is enabled, you can find a snapshot is associated with the database 
Goto the Amazon RDS dashboard, Snapshots -> in the snapshots dashboard you can see the system and manual tab; system tab is auto backup the database by the AWS; you can goto Manual tab to backup manually, click take snapshot and choose the database you want to backup
Or you can back to the RDS dashboard, check the created database, click Actions, you can see Take snapshot, Create read replica, Restore to point in time,
