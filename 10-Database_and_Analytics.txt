Relational Database; Scale Vertically; Amazon RDS, MySQL, IBM DB2, PostgreSQL; talking about column, row, table, schema; use for operation/transaction CRUD operation
Non-Relational Database: Scale Horizontally; DynamoDB, MongoDB, Redis, Neo4j, graph database (store relationships between different people); talking about key value pairs, document; for analytical (like big data)

The data store in analytical database (NonSQL) usually come from the operational databases (SQL); Example, lots of Amazon RDS databases (for operations) copy the data to the centralised data warehouse (eg. Amazon Redshift for data analysis)

Type of database in AWS:
Database on EC2: running database in EC2, fully managed by user
Amazon RDS: AWS managed relation database
Amazon DynamoDB: AWS managed NoSQL
Amazon RedShift: Data warehouse for large volume of aggregated data
Amazon ElasticCache: Fast temporary storage for small amounts of data
Amazon EMR: Analytics workloads using the Hadoop framework

Amazon Relational Database Service (it run on EC2 but fully managed by AWS):  
You can run Amazon Aurora, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL (other than these, you need to run on EC2 by yourself)
It can scale up vertically by upgrade the hardware like CPU, memory
RDS can have disaster recovery and scaling out (horizontally) features:
Disaster Recovery: have 1 RDS Master for read and write in AZ-A, have other RDS Standby in AZ-B, master will sync to standby instance (db should set in different availability zone)
Scaling Out: 1 RDS Master and RDS Read Replica; read replicas use asynchronous replication; RDS read replica is used for scaling read (only for queries);
RDS can be encrypted and take snapshots
RDS can configure with a backup window (backup start time and duration) the backup will become the snapshot; the snapshot can be restored back; in single AZ zone, the DB will be suspension for a while for backup (in multi AZ, no suspension will happen)


[HOL] Create Amazon RDS Database: Amazon RDS, Create database -> standard create, choose engine options (eg. MySQL, MaraDB), edit name of DB, give username and password, edit DB instance (hardware), edit storage, storage autoscaling, you can edit VPC, subnet, Enable automated backups, backup retention period, monitoring, maintenance (auto upgrade for minor version) (free tire will have fewer options)
After the DB is created, select the DB and click Connectivity and Security, find the endpoint which is used to connect to the database
Since the AWS managed RDS also implemented in EC2, therefore an inbound security rule on port 3306 must be enabled
If automatic backup is enabled, you can find a snapshot is associated with the database 
Goto the Amazon RDS dashboard, Snapshots -> in the snapshots dashboard you can see the system and manual tab; system tab is auto backup the database by the AWS; you can goto Manual tab to backup manually, click take snapshot and choose the database you want to backup
Or you can back to the RDS dashboard, check the created database, click Actions, you can see Take snapshot, Create read replica, Restore to point in time,  


[HOL] Read Replicas and Multi-AZ:  
goto Amazon RDS dashboard, select the database, click Actions, Create read replica -> choose the instance specifications (hardware setting, storage type) -> Done
Back to the RDS dashboard, select a database, goto Availability & durability and select Multi-AZ deployment; updating database may course temporary shutdown, you can Scheduling of modifications by setting a time or do it immediately 
after updated to multi-az, goto the RDS click configuration tab you can see multi-az=YES and secondary zone in other AZ 
select the database again, select Actions, reboot, check the Reboot with failover; during the reboot AWS will failover to the standby RDS; you can check the Zone under configuration to check if failover to other AZ successfully


Amazon RDS Security: 
Set RDS Security Group for inbound traffic to the RDS; for EC2 which want to query the database should set and outbound traffic to RDS; you can also set SSL/TLS for EC2 and RDS transmission

[HOL] Create Encrypted Copy of RDS Database: 
You can’t directly backup an unencrypted RDS database to an encrypted RDS database, to achieve it, you need to make use of snapshot
Goto RDS, select snapshots, select an existing snapshot, select Actions, copy snapshot, give the name of snapshot, Enable Encryption
After the snapshot is created, select it and click Actions, Restore snapshot (copy the snapshot to the database), give the DB a name, 


Amazon Aurora: AWS developed more powerful on durability and scalability (AWS growing product); RDS database; Aurora is MySQL and PostgreSQL compatible; 5x faster than MySQL; has distributed, fault-tolerant, self-healing, auto scales feature (can scale to 128TB); Aurora is fault tolerance across 3 AZs, scale-out read request, can promote Aurora replica to new primary, auto scaling to add read replica (when facing high traffic on read), usually have 1 master to write (can set to have multi-master).


Aurora Options: Aurora Fault Tolerance and Aurora Replicas, Cross-Region Replica with Aurora MySQL, Aurora Global Database, Aurora Multi-Master, Aurora Serverless

When shouldn’t we use the RDS? (RDS is AWS managed SQL database)
DB type other than MySQL MariaDB, SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL
RDS can’t allow you to have full access, if you need full access you should do it on EC2 by yourself
