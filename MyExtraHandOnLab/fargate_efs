Docker Hub; docker image we used in this example
https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ryanckhung/gen_file
Please refer to ec2_efs.txt for basic skill

<Step 1> Goto EC2, Create the Security Groups with in bound NFS port enable
<Step 2> Goto EFS, Create the EFS with Networking assign the NFS enabled Security Groups; also create the Access Point
<Step 3> Goto ECS, Create Cluster
<Step 4> Goto ECS (use old AWS portal), Create Task (just like pod in K8s); Remove the port 80 (as not used in this docker image); 
Make the task with
Task execution: roleecsTaskExecutionRole

Add volume and point it to the EFS with the following config:
Volume type: EFS
File System ID: as created
Access Point ID: as created
Root Directory: /
Encryption in transit: ENABLED
EFS IAM authorization: ENABLED

Then inside the container, Storage and Logging, Set the mount point to EFS and the container internal path
