This tutorial will access the DynamoDB. 
The Lambda function will set with the correct IAM role to access teh DynamoDB.

<Step 1> Create the DynamoDB
1. Goto the DynamoDB page, Create Table (give name, partition key and sort key) {by default auto scaling is set}; Set Settings = "Customize settings"; Set Read/write capacity settings = "On-demand" and turn off the auto sacling (for both read and write) and set the Provisioned capacity = 1 
* partition key can asssign as id; and sort key can assign as timestamp (both in number type)

<Step 2> Write Item into the table created in Step 1
1. Goto the Table and "Create item"
2. fill the item with id and timestamp value; you can click "Add new attribute" to the item (eg. name)

<Step 3> Create the IAM policy and role
1. Create the IAM policy and specify the region and the name of the table
2. Create the IAM role and associate the policy (allow the service lambda to access the resource specify in the poilcy)

<Step 4> Create Lambda
1. Goto the Lambda page, select "Author from scratch", give the name and change the permission with the role created in step 3 (Permissions, change default execution role, Use an existing role)
2. Inside the Lambda function edit the code, deploy and test it
