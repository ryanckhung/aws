This example will create a S3 bucket with a file filled with JSON format.
Then Lambda with correct IAM role will be used to access the S3 bucket.
The API Gateway will trigger the Lambda Function.


<Step 1> [S3 Bucket]
1. Create the S3 bucket without setting any bucket policy.
2. Load a file with the following JSON content
   {"success":true, "data":"hello world"}
   
<Step 2> [IAM Role]
1. Create Policy; Choose a service (S3), Actions (Read), Resources (bucket assign the ARN; enter the S3 ARN created in Step 1) [crate a policy to allow Read a particular S3 bucket]
2. Create Role; Service (Lambda), Assign the Policy created above [associate the policy to a Role]
