<Step 0> [Create NFS Securty Groups]
Goto EC2, Create a Security Groups with inbound "NSF PORT 2049" enable

<Step 1> [Create the EFS]
Goto Elastic File System (EFS), "Create file system"; enter the name and click "Customize" button; Goto Networking and update the Security Group (allow NFS);

<Step 2> [Check EFS Mount point]
Back to the EFS, and select the created EFS; then click "Attach" button; copy the mount command (eg. sudo mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2,noresvport fs-0328126279d7448df.efs.ap-east-1.amazonaws.com:/ efs)

<Step 3> [Install NFS Client and Mount to the EFS]
Create EC2 as usual, then goto EC2 terminal and install the nfs-common [NFS Client] by
> sudo apt-get -y install nfs-common
then mount the efs to ec2 by
> sudo mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2,noresvport fs-0328126279d7448df.efs.ap-east-1.amazonaws.com:/ efs
> sudo mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2,noresvport fs-0328126279d7448df.efs.ap-east-1.amazonaws.com:/ <local host path>


<Step 4> Try to kick up more VMs and access the EFS; the file wirtten by VMA should be accessible by VMB


# New Lab: Assume EFS is created and use EC2 to mount to the EFS
<Step 1> Create EC2, no EFS permission is needed (just create a simple EC2 without special setting)
<Step 2> in EC2, create a directory "> mkdir efs"
<Step 3> Install the EFS package (for ubuntu) "sudo apt-get install nfs-common"
<Important> MUST add permission for EFS
- create the security group and allow NFS inbound, and All traffic for outbound
- then goto the efs and goto “Network” -> “Manage” -> Remove the default security group and replace the newly created one
<Step 4> Goto EFS and find the Attach button, then copy something like the following and paste it in the EC2
"> sudo mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2,noresvport fs-0051309b6ed58d5b9.efs.ap-east-1.amazonaws.com:/ efs"
<Important> In EC2, sudo chmod 777 <mount drive folder name>
<Step 5> Done

Remark: You may want to mount the drive to other directory at the same time. 
Eg. map the above efs to the express public, then you need to enter
> mount --bind /home/ubuntu/efs /home/ubuntu/express/public



# Latest Version (simplest version)
1. Create EC2 and no permission is required to set
2. Create a folder in EC2 (eg. > mkdir efs)
3. Install the software in EC2 (sudo apt-get -y install nfs-common)
4. goto the EFS; Attach; copy the command and paste it to EC2
