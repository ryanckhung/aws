1. Create the RDS in Private Subnet (free tier, enter the db name, username=admin, password=password, public access=NO)
2. Update the Security policy of the RDS => Type=MySQL/Aurora (allow the 3306 port for all/particular IP) [MUST enable otherwise it blocked ALL]
3. Copy the Endpoint of the RDS
4. Goto EC2, create EC2 (Ubuntu) without any security setting, put the EC2 in public subnet with the same VPC as RDS (to access RDS is in private subnet)
5. SSH to EC2 and type the following command
> mysql -h <RDS Endpoint> -P 3306 -u admin -p


* REMARK: 
1. if you set public access = YES, it can allow any machines to access; easier for development; for example, you can use MySQL workbench to do the query
2. for primary db, you can use the primary endpoint for both "select" and "insert"
3. for read replica, you should use the read replica endpoint for "select" buy not for "insert"
