<Knowledge 1>
In IAM, you can create a policy to grant permission to a specific resource (eg. a particular S3 - but not all S3)
Then assoicate the policy to a Role or Users

<Knowledge 2>
If you are not using IAM, you can assign a security group to a particular resource like EFS.
eg. when you created the EFS, you can assign a security group and allow all IP to NSF protocol
then other resources (eg. EC2) can access it (EFS) without setting the permission
