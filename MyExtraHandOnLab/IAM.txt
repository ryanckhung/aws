<Knowledge 1>
In IAM, you can create a policy to grant permission to a specific resource (eg. a particular S3 - but not all S3)
Then assoicate the policy to a Role or Users

Reference:
./lambda-apigateway-s3-IAM.txt
./lambda-iam-dynamodb.txt



<Knowledge 2>
If you are not using IAM, you can assign a security group to a particular resource like EFS.
eg. when you created the EFS, you can assign a security group and allow all IP to NSF protocol
then other resources (eg. EC2) can access it (EFS) without setting the permission


<Knowledge 3>
Priority among difference AWS policies (eg. resource base and identity base policy)

<Knowledge 4>
Create a single Policy include mulitple services (eg. policy for access S3 and DynamoDB)
You need to tell
1. Service: S3
2. Action: All S3 actions or list/Read/... etc
3. Resource: all S3 or spcific S3
4. Add additional permissions (add DynamoDB Service)
5. Service: DynamoDB
6. Action: All DynamoDB actions or list/Read/... etc
7. Resource: all DynamoDB or spcific DynamoDB
Final: create a role and associate it to the crated policy
