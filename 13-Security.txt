AWS Directory Service allows to connect the on-premises active directories or your now directory in the cloud
KMS provide various types of encryption that you can implement using KMS
AWS Certificate Manager for SSL/TLS certificates
AWS Web Application Firewall help to protect resources from common web exploits
AWS Shield protects resources against distributed denial of service attack (DDoS)
Security Group, Network ACLs, AWS IAM also provide security


AWS Directory Service: AWS Managed Microsoft Active Directory is a fully AWS managed service
AD Connector: this is useful when you have an existing active directory in the on-premises environment; AD Connector service is going to map the Active Directory credentials (from on-premises) to IAM roles, and they give you the permissions that you need to connect to the AWS service
Simple AD: inexpensive AD compatible service with common directory features; with less features therefore it’s cheaper


Identity Federation: talking about trust relationships between multiple parties; it’s a mechanism to authorise the on-premises services to use the AWS service
Eg. User does have an identity in an on-premises directory store in  this case, using the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, LDAP; We then have an identity provider, it’s something like the active directory federation service. On the AWS side we have STS; the mechanism will allow the client in on-premises machine to get the STS token and access the AWS service


AWS Single Sign On (SSO): trying to be able to authenticate once with the credentials and then get access to a variety of system; and hence no re-authenticate is needed; and we don’t have to supports credentials to different systems; To achieve this we need to implement the SSO and connecting to those various system;


Amazon Cognito is used for adding sing in and signup functionality to the web and mobile;  there are user pools and identity pools;
Cognito user pool is a directory for managing singing and signup for applications; it generate the JWT to the client; the client can use this JWT to access AWS services
User can also using apple, Facebook, Amazon, google account to login through the AWS Cognito services
Cognito identity pools are used to obtain temporary, limited-privilege credentials for AWS services
Use case:  step1: client access the Cognito User Pool  to get the JWT token; step2:  the client exchange the token with Cognito Identity Pool and get the AWS credentials; step3 access AWS services with the AWS credentials
